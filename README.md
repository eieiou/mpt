An effort to port a working emacs lisp translation of various snippets of Mendeleev's periodic table found on common-lisp.net because the GCL was unavailable on certain hardware, where emacs was functional. The attraction of the project is to use the natural-language parser of lisp to help unit translations and basic chemical calculations while doing this with a minimalistic style. We aim to produce no bloatware or timesinks like asdf or other paraphernalia. Was found wanting other free software, specifically (taken as a whole) various python or perl implementations. Ideally this project will be included in the emacs distribution if we ever reach version 1.0 satisfaction, and the licenses of common-lisp.net meet emacs requirements.
